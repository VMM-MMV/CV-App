## About

The CV Generator Web Application streamlines the hiring process, providing fast, consistent resume creation for job seekers and easy acceptance for employers. By making it easy to submit resumes in standard PDF format, it makes the recruitment phase more efficient, saving time for both parties involved.

## Tech Stack Overview

Our CV Generator project is built using various technologies, each serving a specific purpose to ensure the application is fast, reliable, and easy to use. Below is a simplified explanation of what we use:

### Backend with Java:
- [![Java][java_badge]][java_link]: The main language we use for writing our backend logic.
- [![Spring Boot][spring_boot_badge]][spring_boot_link]: Helps us get our application running quickly with less manual configuration.
- [![PostgreSQL][postgresql_badge]][postgresql_link]: This is where all our data is stored. 
- [![Maven][maven_badge]][maven_link]: Tool that help us manage external code libraries that our application depends on.

### Frontend with React.js, HTML, CSS:
- [![React][react_badge]][react_link]: Used for building the interactive parts of our website.
- [![HTML/CSS][html_css_badge]][html_css_link]: These are the building blocks of our web pages. HTML is used for the structure, and CSS makes it look nice.
- [![JavaScript][javascript_badge]][javascript_link]: The scripting language we use to create dynamic content and handle user interactions in the browser.

### Common Tools:
- [![Git][git_badge]][git_link]: This is our version control system, that allows us to track changes and go back to previous versions if needed.
- [![RESTful APIs][restful_apis_badge]][restful_apis_link]: A set of rules that allow our frontend and backend to communicate with each other, sending and receiving data like CV information.
